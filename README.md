# reaction-analysis

In the mouse experiment, we recieved data on mouse and trackpad usage by a small computer program.

First, the program asked the user to enter some basic information, for instance the study major of the user, whether the user would ordinarily write with the right or left hand, would ordinarily use the mouse with the right or the left hand, or would use the trackpad with the right or the left hand.

The experiment itself worked as follows. The user was asked to move their mouse onto the square (of size  11Ã—11  pixels) in the center of the window. After some random delay, given that the user kept the mouse on the square the whole time, a target (a small disk) would appear, at a random distance from the origin in one of eight possible directions. After the target appeared, the user would move the mouse and click on the target.

## The analysis
### Preprocessing and Visualization
The data was cleaned, preprocessed in an appropriate form from the database to seperate reaction time from the individual time series data collected and visualizations for the data analysis.
### Defining "Reaction time"
By conducting experiments the reaction time was defined from the extracted features from the data.
### Forming hypothesis for variability in users' reaction time
After some trial and error the size of the target and the reaction time was selected and appropriate visualizations were performed for testing.

### Hypothesis Testing
The hypotheis was tested using a P test and the hypothesis was found to be true.
## Conclusion
The size of a graphic on the screen highly effects the reaction of a user.This information can be used in Human Computer Interaction to design better and efficient User interfaces.
